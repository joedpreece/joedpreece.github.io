											<h3 class="major">Blockchain Technology for Smart Ticketing</h3>
											<p>
												The article explains how the blockchain-based platform called STUB is developed to create a digital equivalent of a paper ticket recognised by all train operators in Great Britain, which helps improve the passengers' experience, reduces waste, and benefits the GB railway's passenger and commercial experience, although it requires an overhaul of ticket validation points and passengers need to provide credentials to sign up and have a device to access their tickets.</p>
